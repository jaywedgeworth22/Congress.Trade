# FMP Senate recovery production import — 2026-07-22

## Summary

Completed the post-merge production import for PR **#771** (`c17daf3`, feature head `40db88d`) after Deno Deploy revision **`yveah28gatry`** was already healthy. Ran sequential Coolify `admin-maintenance.yml` `fmp-senate-recovery` batches for FMP pages **0–100** (≤5 pages/run), verified idempotency, re-read `data-status`, ran `metadata-enrichment`, and resolved the stale PR **#757** accounting review thread (already fixed on `main` by #762/#764/#766/#769).

This is a **data import + ops closeout**, not a new code deploy.

### Production data-status snapshot (post-enrichment, asOf `2026-07-22T23:59:57.986Z`)

**Transactions**

**Filings (senate)**

- `provider_seeded`: **1,034**
- `persisted`: 13
- `needs_review`: 1

**Filers** (after metadata-enrichment)

- total **312** (was 252 pre-import)
- missing_party **56** (was 112 immediately post-import / 52 pre-import baseline)
- missing_state **29** (was 84 post-import)
- missing_photo **56** (was 112 post-import)

**Queues**

- ingestion outbox: 542 completed, 12 failed
- delivery outbox: 5,969 completed
- runtime ingest: pending ~120 at status time (drain in progress from import-adjacent work)

## Review thread cleanup

- **PR #757** (`app/src/extraction/bakeoff.ts:1361`) — unresolved Codex P2 about metering spend before post-response aborts. **Resolved** after verifying `main` meters via `settleLlmSpend` before `signal?.throwIfAborted()` (landed in #762/#764 + follow-ups #766/#769). Comment posted on PR.
- Open Cursor integration PRs **#774–#777** still have their own threads (not part of this import lane); left untouched.

## Worktrees / secrets

| Path | Action |
|------|--------|
| `/private/tmp/congress-deno-ci-setup` | **Removed** — clean, branch merged (#771) |
| `/private/tmp/congress-senate-crawler` | **Kept** — untracked crawler work; official eFD still Imperva-403 from Coolify IPs |
| `/private/tmp/congress-storage-smoke` | **Kept** — untracked smoke module |
| `/private/tmp/congress-coverage-latency` | **Kept** — ownership not confirmed |
| `/private/tmp/congress-deno-live-ingestion` | **Kept** — dirty vendor tree |
| `/private/tmp/congress-trade-garage-key.qNVqYF` | **Kept** — storage-smoke still present; never printed |

Owner main worktree `cursor/integrate-security-bundle` left untouched.

## Follow-ups

1. **Official Senate eFD scout (residential)** — Coolify/datacenter IPs get HTTP 403 from Imperva; residential Mac gets 200. Not a GitHub Actions runner; see `/private/tmp/congress-senate-crawler`. Primary Senate remains 143 until official path works.
2. **Legacy unknown `seed_dataset` (7,133)** — still historical/low-fidelity; separate cleanup if desired.
3. **Filer metadata gaps** — enrichment reduced but did not eliminate missing party/state/photo; may need another enrichment pass or better name matching for new FMP filers.
4. **Runtime ingest pending** — was non-zero after import; monitor drain; recovery path intentionally does not enqueue delivery for seed inserts.

## Operator notes

- FMP key resolved from Infisical by the Worker; no key was hardcoded.
- Shared FMP pacing/daily budget was respected; no budget bypass.
- Production migrations remain via authenticated `POST /api/admin/migrate` only.
- Mac self-hosted runner was **not** used.
