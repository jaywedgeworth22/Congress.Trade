#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ct-deploy-guard.sh — coalesce, rate-limit and serialize Coolify deploys of
# congress-trade.
#
# WHY (2026-08-10 incident):
#   Every push to main fires a Coolify webhook deploy. During a busy merge
#   window that produced NINE deploys in 47 minutes, several overlapping
#   (server allowed concurrent_builds=2). Each deploy tears down and recreates
#   containers, so every one is a brief outage; overlapping deploys can strand
#   the app with ZERO containers when compose finishes its remove-phase and the
#   start-phase never runs (seen 2026-08-10 ~02:30 by MONET and again ~10:37,
#   the latter a 6h45m outage).
#
# WHAT THIS DOES, once a minute:
#   1. If a deploy is actually running, do nothing (never stack on top).
#   2. If deploys are QUEUED, cancel them all and remember that main is ahead.
#      Coolify always deploys branch HEAD, so one later deploy delivers the
#      newest commit -- N queued merges collapse into ONE deploy.
#   3. Trigger that single deploy only once per MIN_DEPLOY_INTERVAL_SEC.
#   4. EXCEPT when the site is actually down: recovery ignores the rate limit.
#
# Serialization has two layers: this script's flock (only one guard at a time)
# and the Coolify server setting concurrent_builds=1 (set 2026-08-11; keep it
# at 1 -- at 2 the same app can deploy twice at once, which is what stranded
# the containers).
#
# Install:
#   install -m 0755 scripts/ops/ct-deploy-guard.sh /usr/local/bin/
#   install -m 0644 scripts/ops/ct-deploy-guard.service /etc/systemd/system/
#   install -m 0644 scripts/ops/ct-deploy-guard.timer   /etc/systemd/system/
#   systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now ct-deploy-guard.timer
#
# Credentials come from /etc/congress-health-recover.env (COOLIFY_TOKEN,
# PUSHOVER_*). Values are never logged.

# every row's full logs inline. CT has 200+ deployments, some carrying ~280KB of
# log text, so the query grew past Coolify's FastCGI timeout: measured
# 2026-08-12, take=15 -> TIMEOUT, take=3 -> 0.63s. The guard went blind and stood
# down every minute while 4 CT deploys piled up behind one running build.
#
# Shrinking take= would have been WRONG: that endpoint is newest-first, and the
# running deployment is the OLDEST in-flight row, so a small take= silently hides
# it and the guard would stack a new deploy on top of a live build.
#
# /api/v1/deployments returns exactly the running + queued set across all apps
# (measured 3.4s, 10.7KB) — it cannot miss the running one, and it is bounded by
# how much is in flight rather than by history size.
