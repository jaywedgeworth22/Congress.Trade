# ct-reattach-proxy.sh — keep congress-app reachable from Traefik on the
# `coolify` network under a stable DNS alias, and keep the dynamic route file
# pointed at that alias.
#
# Install (Coolify / Hetzner host):
#   install -m 0755 scripts/ops/ct-reattach-proxy.sh /usr/local/bin/
#   cron: * * * * * root /usr/local/bin/ct-reattach-proxy.sh >/var/log/ct-reattach-proxy.log 2>&1
#
# THIS FILE IS THE ENTIRE PUBLIC ROUTE FOR congress.trade.
#   The app container carries NO traefik.* labels (verified 2026-08-12) and the
#   proxy runs with `--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false`, so Traefik's
#   Docker provider produces nothing for this app. The only thing that puts
#   congress.trade on the internet is the file this script writes into
#   /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/, which Traefik watches with
#   `--providers.file.directory=/traefik/dynamic/ --providers.file.watch=true`.
#
# IMPORTANT (2026-08-10): this script used to disconnect and reconnect the
# container from the `coolify` network on EVERY run, including when it was
# already correctly attached. At one run per minute that produced a brief
# unreachable window every 60s — intermittent 502/503 at the edge, and a
# once-a-minute `health FAIL 1/2 -> ok` oscillation in congress-health-recover.
# Those phantom failures also drained the watchdog's hourly restart budget, so
# when the app genuinely died it refused to remediate.
#
# The reconnect is now conditional: it only touches the network when the
# container is missing from `coolify` or is attached WITHOUT the expected
# alias. A correctly-attached container is left alone.
#
# IMPORTANT (2026-08-12): the route file used to be rewritten with
# `cat > "$DYNAMIC_FILE"` on EVERY run. That opens the watched file with
# O_TRUNC, so the file Traefik is watching is momentarily EMPTY. An empty file
# is valid YAML (null), so a reload landing in that window applies a
# configuration with no congress routers at all — and Coolify's own
# `default_redirect_503.yaml` installs a `catchall` router (priority -1000)
# pointing at a service `noop` whose server list is literally `{}`. Traefik's
# load balancer with zero servers answers:
#
#     HTTP 503   no available server
#
# which is exactly the error the owner hit on 2026-08-12. A merely *dead*
# backend does not produce that string — an unresolvable `congress-app` alias
# gives 502 Bad Gateway. "no available server" means the request fell through
# to the catch-all, i.e. our routers were not in the running config.
#
# Two changes remove that window entirely:
#   1. Steady state writes NOTHING. The rendered config is byte-compared with
#      what is already on disk and the file is left untouched when equal, so
#      Traefik sees no inotify event at all (previously: 1440 events/day, each
#      one a chance to catch the file mid-truncate).
#   2. A genuine change is staged in /data/coolify/proxy (mounted into the
#      proxy, but NOT the watched directory) and moved into place with `mv`,
#      which is an atomic rename on the same filesystem. Traefik therefore only
#      ever sees the complete old file or the complete new one.
#      The staging file must NOT live in dynamic/ — Traefik parses every file
#      in that directory, so a temp copy there would briefly duplicate every
#      router name.
#
# The route file is also now written independently of the container: if
# congress-app is missing (mid-deploy, for example) the routers must still
# exist, otherwise the catch-all takes over and turns a 502 into a bare
# "no available server".
#
# IMPORTANT (2026-08-17, #1537): Coolify compose deploys still call
# stop_running_container(force: true) BEFORE compose up, so there is no
# in-project overlap.  ct-deploy-overlap.sh starts `congress-hold` OUTSIDE
# the Coolify project from the live image.  When that container is running
# this script prefers it as the Traefik failover (real app, not the holding
# page).  Standby remains the last-resort fallback when hold is absent.

# Three shapes:
#   * plain      — one server, no Traefik health check. A health check here
#                  would be actively harmful: if it ever failed, congress-svc
#                  would have zero healthy servers and Traefik would answer
#                  "no available server" for every request. Without one,
#                  Traefik just proxies and a dead backend gives 502.
#   * failover   — used when a fallback container is actually running
#                  (hold = live app clone from ct-deploy-overlap.sh; standby
#                  = holding page from ct-standby.service).  Both sit
#                  OUTSIDE the Coolify project so `docker compose ... up`
#                  cannot remove them.  Traefik's `failover` service
#                  requires a health check on the primary; that check is
#                  what flips traffic during the deploy window and back
#                  afterwards.  It probes `/health` — the trivial
#                  `{"ok":true}` liveness route — NOT `/api/health`, which
#                  returns 503 on database or schema trouble and would
#                  divert live traffic while the app was still serving.
#   Hold wins over standby when both are up: clients keep getting the real
#   app instead of a 503 holding page.
