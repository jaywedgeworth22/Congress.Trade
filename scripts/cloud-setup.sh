# IMPORTANT (Claude Code Cloud): Setup script cwd is the PARENT of the clone
# (`/home/user`), not the repo root. A bare `bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh` fails

#   cd Congress.Trade && bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh

# The runnable app lives in app/ (Coolify Deno process), NOT the repo root — so a
# plain `npm ci` from the root fails.  This script cd's into app/ for you.
#
# Local runtime configuration comes from Infisical.  This setup maps the
# app/shared machine-identity bootstrap credentials plus a narrow documented set
# of env-only/local selectors into app/.dev.vars.  Provider and app secrets remain
# in Infisical and are resolved by the app at runtime.
