# Thin wrapper: ship this app's native iOS binary to TestFlight (no Xcode UI).
# Canonical implementation: scripts/ios-fleet/ship-testflight.sh (in this repo).
# The host copy at /Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/ is a runtime install of the same
# file and is used ONLY as a fallback when the in-repo copy is missing.
#
# WHY A MERGE OFTEN DOES NOT PRODUCE A TESTFLIGHT BUILD
# .github/workflows/ios-ship.yml calls this on every push to main touching
# clients/ios/**, but the fleet script enforces a minimum interval between
# successful ships per app: DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=9000 (9000s = 2.5 hours),
# defined near the top of scripts/ios-fleet/ship-testflight.sh. Runs inside that
# window log "ship-gate: skip" and exit 0. It also skips when git HEAD already
# shipped. Neither kind of skip consumes a build number (fixed 2026-08-12).
# Override one run with IOS_TF_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=<seconds> or --force-ship;
# changing the standing limit means editing DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC.
#
# VERSION NUMBERS: MARKETING_VERSION is 1.0.<seq> (+1 every rebuild) and
# CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION is a UTC YYYYMMDDHHMM stamp, so App Store Connect
# shows "1.0.8 (202608121315)" — the parenthetical says when the build was cut
# instead of repeating the version.
#
# STABLE XCODE IS MANDATORY (owner, reaffirmed 2026-08-11).
# Xcode-beta's SDK breaks TestFlight / App Store Connect compatibility: a binary
# built against a beta SDK is accepted into TestFlight but rejected at
# submission as INVALID_BINARY. Version 1.0 has now hit INVALID_BINARY twice.
#
# The fleet script carries its own beta guard. It used to live only outside
# this repo, unversioned — exactly the fragility that left ct-reattach-proxy.sh
# host-only until 2026-08-11 — and is now vendored under scripts/ios-fleet/.
# This wrapper still enforces the rule itself, so the guarantee survives the
# fleet script being changed, moved, or missing.
