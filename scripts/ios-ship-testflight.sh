# Thin wrapper: ship this app's native iOS binary to TestFlight (no Xcode UI).
# Canonical implementation: scripts/ios-fleet/ship-testflight.sh (in this repo).
# The host copy at /Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/ is a runtime install of the same
# file and is used ONLY as a fallback when the in-repo copy is missing.
#
# STABLE XCODE IS MANDATORY (owner, reaffirmed 2026-08-11).
# Xcode-beta's SDK breaks TestFlight / App Store Connect compatibility: a binary
# built against a beta SDK is accepted into TestFlight but rejected at
# submission as INVALID_BINARY. Version 1.0 has now hit INVALID_BINARY twice.
#
# The fleet script carries its own beta guard. It used to live only outside
# this repo, unversioned — exactly the fragility that left ct-reattach-proxy.sh
# host-only until 2026-08-11 — and is now vendored under scripts/ios-fleet/.
# This wrapper still enforces the rule itself, so the guarantee survives the
# fleet script being changed, moved, or missing.
