# Build-time download of a pinned Litestream release into ./bin/litestream.
# Adapted from Usage-Monitor's scripts/fetch-litestream.sh (same pinned
# version, same checksums — verified against the shared v0.5.13 release).
#
# Litestream (https://litestream.io) continuously replicates the SQLite file
# at /data/congress-trade/db.sqlite to Backblaze B2. This script only fetches
# the binary; whether replication actually runs is controlled entirely by the
# LITESTREAM_S3_* env vars at container start — see
# scripts/start-with-litestream.sh. Safe to run even when replication is
# never enabled; it just leaves an unused binary in ./bin.
#
# Pinned version: v0.5.13. NOT v0.5.14 — Socratic.Trade hit a socket-churn
# regression in 0.5.14 on this same Coolify/Hetzner environment (~20
# sockets/s to the S3-compatible endpoint, thousands of leaked fds, kernel
# tcp_mem exhaustion that wedged unrelated deploys on the box). See
# Socratic.Trade docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-deploy-blocker-tcpmem-litestream.md.
# All 0.5.x releases share the LTX replica format, so staying within 0.5.x is
# replica-compatible.
#
# A download or checksum failure leaves the binary absent. That is
# deploy-safe while replication is disabled; if LITESTREAM_S3_* creds resolve
# at startup, the startup wrapper fails closed instead of silently dropping
# the backup path (see scripts/start-with-litestream.sh REQUIRED_KEYS).
