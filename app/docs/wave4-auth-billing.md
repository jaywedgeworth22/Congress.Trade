# Go-live: end-user auth + Stripe paywall (Wave 4)

This is the copy-paste runbook for turning on the public-site **account system**
(Google OAuth + email magic-link) and the **freemium paywall** (Stripe). The code
is already merged and **degrades gracefully** until these are configured:

| Not configured | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` absent | `/billing/checkout` → `503`; Upgrade button shows "billing not configured" |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` absent | `/auth/google/start` → `503`; "Continue with Google" errors cleanly |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`/`EMAIL_FROM` absent | magic-link request returns `{sent:false}` → UI says "try Google" |

So you can deploy now and flip each piece on as you create the accounts.

Set `APP_BASE_URL` first — it's the public origin used to build every OAuth
redirect and magic link (e.g. `https://congress.trade`). If unset we fall back to
the request origin, which is fine for a single domain but explicit is safer.

```bash
cd app
npx wrangler secret put APP_BASE_URL   # e.g. https://congress.trade
```

## 1. Stripe (freemium paywall)

**Pricing (decided):** 7-day free trial → **$15/mo** or **$140/yr**.

1. **Create the product + prices** (Stripe Dashboard → Products, in *live* mode):
   - Product: "Congress.Trade Premium".
   - Add two **recurring** prices: `$15 / month` and `$140 / year`. Copy each
     `price_…` id.
2. **Enable the Billing Portal**: Dashboard → Settings → Billing → Customer portal
   → activate (allow cancel + payment-method updates). This backs the
   "Manage subscription" menu item.
3. **Create the webhook**: Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint:
   - URL: `https://<APP_BASE_URL>/billing/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`,
     `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Copy the **Signing secret** (`whsec_…`).
4. **Set the secrets/vars:**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY        # sk_live_…
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET    # whsec_…
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY     # price_… ($15/mo)
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL      # price_… ($140/yr)
# optional — defaults to 7 if unset; can also live in wrangler.toml [vars]
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_TRIAL_DAYS        # 7
```

**Test before live:** do all of the above in Stripe *test* mode with `sk_test_…`
keys and the test webhook secret; use card `4242 4242 4242 4242`. The trial means
no charge for 7 days, so confirm the flow end-to-end first.

How it reconciles: checkout creates the customer up-front and stores the
`customer ↔ user` link; the `customer.subscription.*` webhooks are the source of
truth for status/plan/period. A user is **premium** while `trialing` or `active`
(see `src/billing/entitlement.ts`).

---

## 2. Google OAuth ("Sign in with Google")

Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services:

1. **OAuth consent screen**: External, add app name + support email, and your
   domain to *Authorized domains*. Scopes needed: `openid`, `email`, `profile`.
2. **Credentials → Create OAuth client ID → Web application**:
   - Authorized JavaScript origin: `https://<APP_BASE_URL>`
   - Authorized redirect URI: `https://<APP_BASE_URL>/auth/google/callback`
   - (add `http://localhost:8787/...` variants for local `wrangler dev`)
3. Set the secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID       # …apps.googleusercontent.com
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET   # GOCSPX-…
```

---

## 3. Resend (magic-link emails)

1. Resend → add + **verify your sending domain** (DNS records).
2. Create an API key.
3. Set:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY   # re_…
npx wrangler secret put EMAIL_FROM        # "Congress.Trade <login@congress.trade>"
```

`EMAIL_FROM` must be a verified sender on that domain. Until set, magic-link
requests no-op gracefully and the UI nudges users to Google sign-in.

---

## 4. Cloudflare Access for the admin surface

The in-page Admin tabs (poll cadence, review queue, backfill) call `/api/admin/*`,
which returns `401/403` on the public site (the dashboard shows
"Admin tools have moved to admin.congress.trade"). Gate that subdomain with
Cloudflare Access + Google so admin is one-click SSO, **not** OTP-every-24h.

1. **Route the subdomain to the Worker**: add to `wrangler.toml` `routes` and
   redeploy (the zone is already on the account):
   ```toml
   { pattern = "admin.congress.trade", custom_domain = true }
   ```
2. **Zero Trust → Access → Applications → Add → Self-hosted**:
   - Application domain: `admin.congress.trade`
   - **Session Duration: 1 month** (this is the knob that removes the
     OTP-every-24h annoyance).
3. **Identity provider = Google** (Zero Trust → Settings → Authentication → add
   Google as a login method) so the Access login is "Sign in with Google" (SSO),
   not an emailed PIN.
4. **Policy**: Allow → Include → *Emails* = your admin address(es).

Behind Access, the browser carries the Access cookie automatically, so the admin
panels work on the subdomain with no token to paste.

## 5. Apply migrations, deploy, smoke-test

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run test
ADMIN_TOKEN=... bash scripts/ship.sh
```

`ship.sh` deploys the Worker and applies the idempotent `POST /api/admin/migrate`
path through the Worker binding. Do not use remote Wrangler D1 migrations on this
account.

Smoke test:
- `GET /auth/me` → `{ "user": null, "entitlement": { "premium": false, … } }`
- `GET /billing/status` → `{ "configured": true, … }` once Stripe keys are set
- Sign in (Google + magic-link), then **Upgrade → Start free trial** → Stripe
  Checkout → back to `/?checkout=success` with the **Premium** badge showing.
- As a free user, the feed shows the **last 30 days** + a "🔒 unlock full history"
  CTA; **Export CSV** opens the upgrade modal. As premium, both unlock.

## 6. Historic backfill

Once deployed, seed back-history — see
[`DEPLOY.md`](../DEPLOY.md) §5, e.g.:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<APP_BASE_URL>/api/admin/backfill \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"chambers":["house","senate"],"sinceYear":2014}'   # add "dryRun":true to preview
```

For higher-fidelity House history, use the official House index backfill in
bounded batches. `dryRun` counts matching PTRs without writing rows or enqueueing
work; non-dry runs default to `maxFilings: 500` unless a different cap is sent.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<APP_BASE_URL>/api/admin/house-backfill \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"fromYear":2024,"toYear":2026,"maxFilings":500,"dryRun":true}'
```
