/**
 * src/extraction/ogeText.ts
 * OWNER: extraction agent
 *
 * Extractor for the dedicated OGE Form 278-T "Periodic Transaction Report"
 * PDF filed by executive-branch personnel (docKind 'text_pdf', chamber
 * 'executive'). Purely deterministic text-layer parsing — no network calls,
 * no model calls.
 *
 * The 278-T renders its transactions as a single flat table with columns:
 *   # | DESCRIPTION | TYPE | DATE | NOTIFICATION RECEIVED OVER 30 DAYS AGO | AMOUNT
 * e.g. one logical row reads:
 *
 *   1 Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Sale 06/10/2022 No $1,001 - $15,000
 *
 * IMPORTANT: unpdf's mergePages text-layout heuristic (pdf.js's line-break
 * insertion, driven by Y-coordinate deltas between text items) is NOT
 * guaranteed to insert a newline between rows — verified in production
 * (Cloudflare Workers runtime) that an entire multi-page 278-T comes back as
 * ONE line with no `\n` at all, while the same PDF parsed locally under
 * Node.js does insert per-row newlines. Parsing therefore does NOT split on
 * `\n` and match per line (that silently found 0 rows in production while
 * finding 3/3 in local Node testing — a real incident, not a hypothetical).
 * Instead the whole merged text is whitespace-normalized to single spaces
 * (folding away import '\n'/'\r' too) and scanned with a GLOBAL regex, the
 * same technique textPdf.ts's parseInlineRecords() uses for the same reason.
 * `\s+` matches a real newline just as well as a run of spaces, so this
 * approach is correct under EITHER text-layout behavior.
 *
 * This is a DIFFERENT layout from the House PTR text_pdf format that
 * textPdf.ts targets (House rows carry an owner code + a bracketed asset-type
 * code; OGE 278-T rows have neither). Routing an executive filing through the
 * House-tuned parser silently yields zero rows — OgePdfExtractor claims
 * chamber==='executive' text_pdf and scanned_pdf filings ahead of the generic
 * TextPdfExtractor in buildExtractorPipeline() and runs this parser first.
 * True scans that yield zero rows then take a fail-soft OpenRouter vision
 * path; this class itself still only claims text_pdf.
 *
 * SCOPE: the dedicated 278-T "Periodic Transaction Report" form only. The
 * broader OGE 278e annual/termination disclosure (a much larger multi-section
 * form whose own Part 7 "Transactions" table uses a harder-to-bound layout
 * interleaved with unrelated numbered lists — positions held, agreements,
 * assets) is intentionally NOT row-parsed: ROW_RE requires the full
 * type+date+notification+amount suffix to immediately follow the description,
 * so 278e prose fails to match and yields zero rows, never a wrong parse.
 * A Part 7 body that is only None / N/A / No transactions is an honest empty
 * (looksLikeOgePart7ExplicitNone → verified_empty).  A 278e with no 278-T
 * table and no other successful read is the same close even without the
 * word None.  A refused or unreadable 278-T (index/coverage gate, or a
 * periodic report with no readable rows) is not that empty.  Callers must
 * not treat a refusal as "nothing to report".
