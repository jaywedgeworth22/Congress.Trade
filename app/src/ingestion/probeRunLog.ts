 *
 * DURABLE RECORD OF EVERY COMPETITOR PROBE — including the ones that find
 * nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `trade_provider_observations.first_observed_at` records the moment WE first
 * saw a competitor carrying a filing. It has been read as if it were the
 * moment the COMPETITOR PUBLISHED it. It is not, and the difference is the
 * entire latency edge.
 *
 * If we probe every 30 minutes, a filing the competitor published at 10:00 is
 * first seen at 10:29, and a naive lead calculation credits us 29 minutes we
 * did not earn. Measured on production data (2026-08-16..19) this produced
 * leads quantised onto a handful of values — quiver AND unusual_whales both
 * reporting exactly 68.28h and 147.28h across dozens of rows, which is
 * impossible for real publication times and is simply our own probe schedule
 * showing through.
 *
 * The honest statement is an INTERVAL, not a point. If the probe at T finds a
 * row that the probe at T_prev did not, the competitor published somewhere in
 * (T_prev, T]. That requires knowing T_prev — which requires recording probes
 * that found NOTHING, because those are exactly the ones that establish the
 * lower bound. `probeCadenceLog.ts` writes to the console and deliberately
 * suppresses most lines, so it cannot answer this. Hence a table.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT CALLERS MUST DO
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Order matters and is easy to get wrong:
 *
 *   1. read `previousSuccessfulProbeAt()`  <- BEFORE recording this run
 *   2. stamp new observations with that value as `prev_probe_at`
 *   3. `recordProbeRun()` for this run
 *
 * Recording first would make the current run its own predecessor and collapse
 * every bracket to zero width — which would look like a perfect measurement
 * and be entirely fictional.
 *
 * Only SUCCESSFUL probes bound the interval. A probe that threw or was rate
 * limited did not observe the competitor's absence, so it cannot establish
 * that the row was not yet published. Failed runs are still recorded (they are
 * needed to explain gaps and to drive the lease handoff) but are excluded from
 * the predecessor lookup.
