 *
 * ADAPTIVE PROBE CADENCE — proportional allocation of a FIXED daily probe
 * budget across measured filing-arrival windows, clamped by a coverage floor
 * and a peak:trough ratio ceiling, then renormalised so the budget still fits.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS (and is not)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module decides HOW OFTEN a source should be probed. It does NOT decide
 * WHO probes (server vs Mac — that is the lease in scoutHandoff.ts), it does
 * NOT perform I/O, and it never writes anything. Every exported function is
 * pure and deterministic: same (source, clock, config) in, same answer out.
 *
 * It is designed to be adopted by three existing callers WITHOUT this module
 * having to know anything about them:
 *   1. shared/config.ts    shouldPollNow()               -> probeIntervalSecAt()
 *   2. ingestion/watcher.ts                              -> passes the source id
 *   3. ingestion/tradeLatency.ts disclosurePublishYieldWeight() -> probeYieldWeightAt()
 * See app/docs/probe-schedule.md for the exact integration diff.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ALLOCATION RULE (owner spec, 2026-08-11)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "if X times more likely for filing to be during X timeframe then it is wise
 *  to have X times more checks during that timeframe ... but make it
 *  proportional to how often filings are released during that timeframe based
 *  on historical data ... while still ensuring some baseline of checks at
 *  minimum ... don't let it be more than 4x as often during peaks as lowest
 *  times or whatever you recommend."
 *
 * Implemented literally, as arithmetic, in `allocateProbes()`:
 *
 *   a. w_i  = measured arrival-event share of window i  (see MEASURED_* below)
 *   b. n_i  = w_i * B                                   (proportional, pre-clamp)
 *   c. FLOOR:   n_i >= ceil(T_i / maxIntervalSec)        (no window is starved)
 *   d. CEILING: n_i <= floor(T_i / peakFloorIntervalSec) where
 *               peakFloorIntervalSec = max(minIntervalSec, maxIntervalSec / R)
 *               so peak cadence is never more than R x trough cadence
 *   e. RENORMALISE: water-fill the residual budget over the windows that are
 *      still unclamped, proportional to their w_i, iterating to a fixpoint.
 *      Without this step the clamps would silently blow the cap.
 *
 * `allocateProbes()` reports BOTH the pre-clamp (`proportionalProbes`) and
 * post-clamp (`probes`) numbers on every window so the cost of the clamp is
 * visible rather than buried.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BUDGET ARITHMETIC (the "provably under cap" proof)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two independent guarantees, both asserted in __tests__/probeSchedule.test.ts:
 *
 *   (1) ALLOCATION: sum(n_i) <= effectiveBudget = floor(B * (1 - retryHeadroom))
 *       <= B. Enforced by the water-fill: the residual handed to unclamped
 *       windows is (effectiveBudget - sum(clamped n_i)), never more; and the
 *       integer rounding step only ever hands out the exact shortfall.
 *       If the FLOORS alone exceed the budget (a mis-retune), the floors are
 *       scaled back and `degraded: true` is set — the cap always wins.
 *
 *   (2) REALISED: intervalSec_i = ceil(T_i / n_i), so probes actually taken in
 *       window i = floor(T_i / intervalSec_i) <= n_i. Ceil (not round) is what
 *       makes this hold. The watcher ticks once per minute, which discretises
 *       the interval upward again, so realised spend is strictly <= planned.
 *
 * Worked example, HOUSE weekday, B = 171 probes/day (today's spend), 10% retry
 * headroom => effectiveBudget = 153:
 *
 *   window                 T_i (s)   events  w_i     n_i(prop)  n_i(final)  interval
 *   PEAK  08:55-09:40 ET      2700     25    .78125     119.5       45         60s
 *   HIGH  09:40-12:00 ET      8400      3    .09375      14.3       35        240s
 *   MID   12:00-20:00 ET     28800      4    .12500      19.1       46        627s
 *   LOW   20:00-08:55 ET     46500      0    .00000       0.0       26       1789s
 *                            -----                       -----     ---
 *                            86400                       153       152  <= 153 <= 171
 *
 *   PEAK was cut 119.5 -> 45 by the 60s politeness floor; LOW was raised
 *   0 -> 26 by the 30-minute coverage floor; the 82 probes freed by the PEAK
 *   clamp were water-filled back into HIGH and MID in their 3:4 weight ratio.
 *   Achieved peak:trough = 1789 / 60 = 29.8x.
 *
 * WHAT THE TROUGH DROPS TO (stated plainly, as required):
 *   weekday 20:00-08:55 ET : 1200s (20 min) -> 1789s (~30 min)   WORSE
 *   weekday 12:00-20:00 ET :  300s ( 5 min) ->  627s (~10.5 min) WORSE
 *   weekday 09:40-12:00 ET :  300s ( 5 min) ->  240s ( 4 min)    better
 *   weekday 08:55-09:40 ET :  300s ( 5 min) ->   60s ( 1 min)    5x better
 *   weekend                : 3600s (60 min) -> 3600s (60 min)    unchanged
 *
 * The overnight and mid-day windows are what pay for the 09:00 burst. That is
 * the reallocation; the daily total does not go up. Weekend cadence is left
 * exactly as it is today because the budget is per-DAY: cutting Saturday buys
 * nothing for Monday, so cutting it would be pure loss.
 *
 * A 30-minute weekday / 60-minute weekend floor is far inside the
 * `pollSuccessMaxAgeHours` = 6h liveness thresholds in shared/pipelineHealth.ts,
 * so no health check regresses.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE FLOOR IS 30 MINUTES (not a round number picked for looks)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Derived from the worst acceptable detection delay, not from aesthetics. A
 * filing published at 03:00 ET has no market consequence until the 09:30 ET
 * open; detecting it by 03:30 leaves six hours of margin, so overnight latency
 * is worth ~nothing competitively. What overnight coverage IS worth:
 *   - off-schedule / corrected publications, which do happen;
 *   - the durable per-attempt liveness receipts the polling_house /
 *     polling_senate health checks depend on;
 *   - never being able to say "we were not looking".
 * 30 minutes buys all three at 26 probes/day (17% of the House budget).
 * Zero is never permitted for any window: `probes >= 1` is a hard invariant.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY R = 30 AND NOT THE SUGGESTED 4
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The owner invited a recommendation. The measured peak:trough YIELD ratio is
 * unbounded (78% of House arrival events land in one 45-minute window; 0 of 32
 * events landed in the 13 overnight hours across 380 covered polling-hours), so
 * the clamp is doing pure damage-limitation, not tracking the data.
 *
 * The tail is ALREADY protected by the absolute 30-minute floor, which is a
 * strictly stronger and more legible guarantee than a ratio: "every window,
 * every hour, at least one probe every 30 minutes". The ratio ceiling is a
 * second, redundant guard whose only remaining effect is to cap the peak.
 *
 * R = 4 with a 30-minute floor forces peakFloorIntervalSec = 450s, i.e. a
 * 7.5-MINUTE cadence across the 09:00 burst — worse than today's 300s, and it
 * strands ~25% of the daily budget as unspendable (every window saturates at
 * the ratio ceiling with probes left over). Run
 * `allocateProbes(HOUSE_PROFILE, 'weekday', { peakTroughRatioCap: 4 })` to see
 * it; the test suite pins that outcome.
 *
 * R = 30 makes the ratio ceiling coincide exactly with the 60s politeness
 * floor, i.e. the floor binds and the ratio never does. That is the honest
 * design: ONE binding constraint (60s), not two fighting each other. R stays
 * configurable so the owner can dial it back and see the cost directly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TIER COUNT RECOMMENDATION: 4 for House and providers, 3 for Senate
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Recommended from the measured curve, per source, not a uniform guess:
 *   HOUSE (n = 32 arrival events / 27 days) -> 4 tiers. The curve genuinely has
 *     four regimes: a 45-minute burst (78%), a late-morning shoulder (9%), a
 *     low-but-nonzero business tail (13%), and a 13-hour measured zero. Two
 *     tiers cannot express both a 45-minute burst and a 13-hour zero without
 *     wasting one of them; 5+ would over-fit 32 events.
 *   SENATE (n = 10 events / 7 days) -> 3 tiers. The 12:00-16:00 and 18:00-21:00
 *     densities are 0.75 and 0.67 events/hour: indistinguishable at n = 10.
 *     Splitting them would be inventing structure the sample cannot support, so
 *     they are merged into one HIGH tier. This is the honest answer, not the
 *     thorough-looking one.
 *   PROVIDERS -> 4 tiers, on the UNION of both chambers' peaks, because one
 *     provider call covers both chambers.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PROVENANCE + EXPIRY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Windows come from a 52-day measurement (2026-06-21 .. 2026-08-11) over the
 * production SQLite store, filtered to arrivals attributable to a logged poll
 * of the same source within 30 minutes and exposure-normalised per ET hour
 * (24-32 covered hours in every bucket, so the concentration is not a polling
 * artifact). Full method + tables: app/docs/probe-schedule.md.
 *
 * TWO CAVEATS THE NUMBERS CARRY:
 *   - The window is entirely inside the August recess run-up, which suppresses
 *     volume. It locates the WINDOWS reliably; it is thin for permanent
 *     WEIGHTS. Re-measure in a session month.
 *   - Senate n = 10 events over 7 days is directional only.
 * Both are why every boundary and weight is overridable from config without a
 * deploy (see probeScheduleConfigFromEnv). Deriving the windows from a rolling
 * query instead of this frozen table is the logical next step and is left as a
 * documented follow-up rather than gold-plated here.
