 * "N of M matched" — the scope denominator.

 *
 *   1. In window. The line entered one of the two feeds within
 *      `windowHours` (14 days, {@link LATENCY_PROVIDER_MATCH_LOOKBACK_HOURS}) —
 *      `congress_first_seen_at` for our side, `first_observed_at` for the
 *      provider side. One window, applied to whichever clock the row has.
 *      This is deliberately the LONGER of the two windows in this module: the
 *      7-day score window governs lead-time statistics, not coverage.
 *   2. In our realm of concern. Sitting House members, sitting Senate members,
 *      and the executive filers we track by name — POTUS, VP, and the
 *      Senate-confirmed cabinet secretaries / agency heads curated in
 *      `shared/executiveIdentity.ts`. House and Senate lane rows qualify by
 *      construction: both our crawlers and every provider's congressional
 *      endpoint are already restricted to sitting members. Executive lane rows
 *      qualify ONLY when the disclosed name resolves to a curated executive.
 *      Anything else — an unknown chamber, an executive-lane name we do not
 *      track, a row with no filer name at all — is EXCLUDED from both N and M
 *      and counted in `excludedOutOfScope`, never quietly parked in the
 *      denominator where it would depress the ratio.
 *   3. Live. Backfills and historical crawls are excluded on our side
 *      ({@link isLiveRaceImport}); they are not races and were never eligible
 *      to be won or lost.
 *
 * A line both sides saw counts ONCE. Provider observations that carry a
 * confirmed pairing are folded onto the paired candidate's `trade_hash`, so a
 * provider whose hash differs from ours cannot inflate M by appearing as a
 * second, separate disclosure.
 *
 * WHAT N COUNTS (`matched`). The subset of M carrying a STRONG CT <-> provider
 * pairing (see {@link matchStrength}). `matchedIncludingWeak` adds the
 * weak-method pairings for anyone who wants the looser figure; the headline is
 * the strong one.
 *
 * WHAT M IS NOT. It is not "every disclosure Congress filed" — we cannot count
 * filings neither side has seen. M is the union of what the two feeds
 * surfaced.
 *
 * READ `providerOnly` AS AN UPPER BOUND, NOT A MISS COUNT. A provider "latest"
 * endpoint returns rows by DISCLOSURE date, and a filing disclosed this week
 * routinely contains transactions from a year or more ago that congress.trade
 * already ingested — before this window, so with no in-window candidate to
 * pair against. Those land in `providerOnly` even though we have the trade.
 * The number that is unambiguously ours to fix is the subset where we have no
 * record of the trade at all; measuring that needs a join against
 * `transactions`, which this function deliberately does not do.

 * observations ended up with `filer_name = NULL` and a trade hash whose

 *   1. `nameKeys` — the provider's declared full-name field.
 *   2. `firstName` + `lastName` — unambiguous structured name parts.
 *   3. `fallbackNameKeys` — display fields that USUALLY hold a person but are
 *      not contractually a name (FMP's `office`), tried last so a provider
 *      that ever repurposes one cannot outrank the structured parts.
 *
 * The result goes through {@link cleanFilerName} — the SAME normalizer the
 * House/Senate extraction path uses on our own side of the race — so both
 * sides strip honorifics, flip "Last, First", and apply the curated
 * legal-name aliases (Rohit -> Ro Khanna) identically. Two sides normalized by
 * two different functions is how a join silently drifts.

 * filing's live parsed transactions, for up to `UW_DEEP_MATCH_DATES_PER_RUN`

 * successive runs cycle through the whole backlog instead of re-selecting the
 * same dates forever. `attempts` breaks the tie the normal pass leaves when
 * it stamps every pending row with the same last_checked_at in the same run:
 * deep-pass targets accrue an extra attempt, pushing them behind untargeted
 * rows on the next run.
 *
 * Matches found this way still get providerFirstSeenAt from the observation
 * row's DB-canonical first_observed_at (monitor-first-seen), the same honest
 * lower-bound semantics this provider already uses for its normal pass; we
 * never fabricate a provider-published timestamp from a deep-match hit.
 *
 * Only called when the normal pass's fetch already succeeded (freshRows
 * non-empty), so once a trial UW key lapses and the normal fetch starts

 *            bought the same ticker twice can pair against the wrong line.
 *            `fuzzy-no-ticker` pairs on person+date+side with the security
 *            unverified, so two different holdings disclosed the same day can
 *            pair with each other.
 *
 * Only STRONG feeds the headline (`matched`, `strongMatched`, `ctCoveragePct`,
 * lead/win timing). WEAK is reported separately so coverage can be honest
 * about rows we believe we paired without pretending they carry the same
 * evidentiary weight. Both tiers count as "not unmatched" — a weakly paired
 * provider row is not a coverage gap, it is a lower-confidence pairing.
