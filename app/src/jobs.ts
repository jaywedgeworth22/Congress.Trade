 *    price series frozen at 2026-08-03 for 46 days because the one FMP
 *    refresh attempt 401/403'd but the day-stamp stuck.
 *
 *  - `:lastdate:<lane>` (SUBCLAIM_KEY_PREFIX) — stamp BEFORE running, for
 *    one-shot sub-features nested inside a lane (currently the R2 usage
 *    digest inside the retention lane). Cross-worker overlap for those
 *    sub-features is already prevented by the parent lane's DB singleton
 *    lock (see deno/cronLanes.ts:runDailyLane), so the cheap-no-op

/**
 * Delete filings, transactions, and corresponding R2 PDFs that are older than 5 years.
 * We rely on 'filed_date' from filings table.
 *
 * Rows with a NULL filed_date would never satisfy `filed_date < ?` (NULL
 * comparisons are not true), so they accumulated forever; the sweep now falls
 * back to the ingestion date (`first_seen_at`) for those rows — a filing we
 * ingested more than 5 years ago whose source never yielded a filed_date is
 * safe to prune. Delivery bookkeeping rows (deliveries / delivery_outbox) that
 * reference the batch's transactions are deleted alongside them so the sweep
 * does not orphan delivery rows pointing at removed transactions.
 *
 * TWO SAFETY RULES (2026-08-11), both learned the hard way:
 *
 * 1. THE ARCHIVED DOCUMENT IS NEVER DESTROYED BY DEFAULT.
 *    This sweep used to hard-delete the R2 object with no export, no
 *    tombstone, no bucket versioning and no flag — the stored copy is the
 *    ONLY durable artifact in the system (everything else is recomputed from
 *    it), and serving is stored-copy-only, so losing it is unrecoverable: the
 *    filing cannot be re-read, re-extracted or re-reviewed, ever. The DB rows
 *    can be rebuilt from the document; the document cannot be rebuilt from the
 *    rows. Deleting the object is now opt-in via RETENTION_DELETE_RAW_OBJECTS.
 *
 * 2. NEVER PRUNE SOMETHING WE ONLY JUST INGESTED.
 *    The predicate keys on filed_date, so a 2020 PTR discovered by a
 *    historical backfill TODAY was immediately eligible — the backfill lanes
 *    (houseCrawler / senateCrawler / seed) exist precisely to ingest filings
 *    older than the cutoff, so the two lanes fought each other: backfill
 *    ingests, next day's sweep destroys, forever. Rows first seen within
 *    RETENTION_MIN_AGE_DAYS are now protected regardless of filed_date.
