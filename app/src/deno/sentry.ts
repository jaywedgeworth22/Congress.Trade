/**
 * Production `#sentry` binding for the Coolify Docker container
 * (Deno-in-Docker on the Hetzner fleet box).  Not Deno Deploy.
 *
 * `@sentry/deno` is the official Sentry SDK for the Deno *runtime*.  It
 * inits in-process and POSTs envelopes over fetch — no deployctl, no
 * deno.com Deploy APIs, no Deploy integration.  `initProductionSentry` is
 * the boot path used by `main.ts` after Infisical refresh.  Capture/monitor
 * helpers no-op until Coolify/Infisical provides a DSN and `init` succeeds.
