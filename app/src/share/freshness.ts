/**

 * OWNER: foundation
 *
 * Cross-app freshness watchdog (App A's half of the mutual health check). Once a
 * day the cron compares how stale the market-data streams a sibling app keeps
 * current — S&P closes, per-ticker prices, and the fundamentals it pushes — are
 * against generous thresholds. If a stream that WAS being kept current goes
 * stale (App B's nightly push silently broke, or our own price refresh is
 * failing), we email a throttled admin alert via the same path as the FMP-tier
 * alert. Streams that were never populated (null latest) are skipped so a
 * not-yet-wired partner never trips a false alarm.
 *
 * The decision logic (evaluateFreshness) is pure + deterministic so it unit-
 * tests without a database or clock.
